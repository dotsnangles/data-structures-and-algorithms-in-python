    "- The time Complexity of the implementation is O(V^2). If the input graph is represented using adjacency list, it can be reduced to O(E log V) with the help of a binary heap. Please see Dijkstra’s Algorithm for Adjacency List Representation for more details.\n",
    "- Dijkstra’s algorithm **doesn’t work** for **graphs with negative weight cycles**. It may give correct results for a graph with negative edges but you must allow a vertex can be visited multiple times and that version will lose its fast time complexity. For graphs with negative weight edges and cycles, the **Bellman-Ford algorithm** can be used, we will soon be discussing it as a separate post."
