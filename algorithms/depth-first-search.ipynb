    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- Depth-first search is an algorithm for **traversing or searching tree or graph** data structures. \n",
    "- The algorithm **starts at the root node** (**selecting some arbitrary node** as the root node in the case of a graph) \n",
    "- and explores as far as possible along each branch **before backtracking**. \n",
    "- So the basic idea is to **start from the root** or any arbitrary node \n",
    "- and **mark the node** \n",
    "- and **move to the adjacent unmarked node** \n",
    "- and **continue** this loop until there is no unmarked adjacent node. \n",
    "- **Then backtrack** and **check for other unmarked nodes** and traverse them. Finally, print the nodes in the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a **recursive function** that takes the **index of the node** and a **visited array**.\n",
    "- Mark the **current node as visited** and print the node.\n",
    "- **Traverse** all the **adjacent** and **unmarked** nodes \n",
    "- and **call the recursive function** with the **index of the adjacent** node."
