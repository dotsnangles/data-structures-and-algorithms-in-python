    "- in which the tree is a **complete binary tree**.\n",

    "### Operations of Heap Data Structure\n",
    "- **Heapify**\n",
    "  - a process of **creating a heap from an array**.\n",
    "- **Insertion**\n",
    "  - process to **insert an element** in existing heap time complexity O(log N).\n",
    "- **Deletion**\n",
    "  - **deleting the top element** of the heap **or the highest priority** element, \n",
    "  - **and then organizing** the heap **and returning the element** with time complexity O(log N).\n",
    "- **Peek**\n",
    "  - to **check or find** the most prior element in the heap, (max or min element for max and min heap).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Heap Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generally, Heaps can be of two types\n",
    "- **Max-Heap**\n",
    "  - the **key** present at the **root** node **must be greatest** among the keys present at all of it’s children. \n",
