    "## Binary Heap\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Binary Heap is a Binary Tree with following properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It’s a **complete tree**.\n",
    "  - All levels are **completely filled except** possibly the **last level** and the **last level** has **all keys** **as left as possible**\n",
    "- This property of Binary Heap makes them **suitable** to be **stored in an array**.\n",
    "- A Binary Heap is either **Min Heap or Max Heap**. \n",
    "- In a **Min Binary Heap**, the **key at root** must be **minimum among all** keys present in Binary Heap. \n",
    "- The same property must be recursively true for all nodes in Binary Tree. Max Binary Heap is similar to MinHeap.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is Binary Heap represented?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **Binary Heap** is a **Complete Binary Tree**. A binary heap is typically **represented as an array**.\n",
    "- The **root** element will be at Arr[0].\n",
    "- Below table shows **indexes of other nodes** for the ith node, i.e., Arr[i]:\n",
    "  - Arr[**(i-1)/2**] Returns the **parent** node\n",
    "  - Arr[**(2*i)+1**] Returns the **left child** node\n",
    "  - Arr[**(2*i)+2**] Returns the **right child** node\n",
    "- The traversal method use to achieve Array representation is Level Order\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications of Heaps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Heap Sort**\n",
    "  - Heap Sort uses **Binary Heap** to **sort an array** in O(nLogn) time.\n",
    "- **Priority Queue**\n",
    "  - Priority queues can be efficiently **implemented using Binary Heap** \n",
    "  - because it supports insert(), delete() and extractmax(), decreaseKey() operations in O(logn) time. \n",
    "  - **Binomoial Heap** and **Fibonacci Heap** are variations of Binary Heap. \n",
    "  - These variations perform union also efficiently.\n",
    "- **Graph Algorithms**\n",
    "  - The **priority queues** are especially used in **Graph Algorithms** \n",
    "  - like **Dijkstra’s Shortest Path** and **Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree**.\n",
    "- Many problems can be efficiently solved using Heaps. See following for example.\n",
    "  - **K’th Largest Element in an array**.\n",
    "  - **Sort an almost sorted array**.\n",
    "  - **Merge K Sorted Arrays**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations on Min Heap\n",
    "\n",
    "- **getMini()**\n",
    "  - It returns the **root** element **of Min Heap**. \n",
    "  - Time Complexity of this operation is O(1).\n",
    "- **extractMin()**\n",
    "  - **Removes** the **minimum** element **from MinHeap**. \n",
    "  - Time Complexity of this Operation is O(Logn) \n",
    "  - as this operation needs to **maintain the heap property** (by calling heapify()) after removing root.\n",
    "- **decreaseKey()**\n",
    "  - Decreases value of key. The time complexity of this operation is O(Logn). \n",
    "  - If the **decreased key value** of a node is **greater than the parent** of the node, \n",
    "  - then we **don’t need to do anything**. \n",
    "  - **Otherwise**, we need to traverse up to **fix the violated heap property**.\n",
    "- **insert()**\n",
    "  - Inserting a new key takes O(Logn) time. \n",
    "  - We **add** a new key **at the end** of the tree. \n",
    "  - If **new key** is **greater than its parent**, then we **don’t need** to do anything. \n",
    "  - **Otherwise**, we need to **traverse up to fix the violated heap property**.\n",
    "- **delete()**\n",
    "  - Deleting a key also takes O(Logn) time. \n",
    "  - We **replace the key** to be deleted **with minus infinite** by calling decreaseKey(). \n",
    "  - After decreaseKey(), the **minus infinite value must reach root**, so we call **extractMin() to remove the key**."
