    "## Binary Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "- A tree is a popular data structure that is **non-linear** in nature. \n",
    "- Unlike other data structures like array, stack, queue, and linked list which are linear in nature, \n",
    "- a tree represents a **hierarchical structure**. \n",
    "- The **ordering information** of a tree is **not important**. \n",
    "- A tree contains **nodes** and **2 pointers**. \n",
    "- These two pointers are the **left child** and the **right child** of the **parent node**. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The terms of tree \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Root**\n",
    "  - The root of a tree is the **topmost node** of the tree that has no parent node. \n",
    "  - There is **only one root** node in every tree.\n",
    "- **Edge**\n",
    "  - Edge acts as **a link** between the **parent** node and the **child** node.\n",
    "- **Leaf**\n",
    "  - A node that **has no child** is known as the leaf node. It is the **last node** of the tree. There can be **multiple leaf nodes** in a tree.\n",
    "- **Subtree**\n",
    "  - The subtree of a node is the tree **considering** that **particular node** as the **root** node.\n",
    "- **Depth**\n",
    "  - The depth of the node is the **distance** from the **root** node to that **particular node**.\n",
    "- **Height**\n",
    "  - The height of the node is the **distance** from that **node** to the **deepest node** of that subtree.\n",
    "- **Height of tree**\n",
    "  - The Height of the tree is the **maximum height** of any node. This is same as the height of root node\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Trees? \n",
    "\n",
    "- One reason to use trees might be because you want to **store information** that naturally forms a **hierarchy**. For example, the file system on a computer. \n",
    "- Trees (with some ordering e.g., BST) provide **moderate access/search** \n",
    "  - (quicker than Linked List and slower than arrays). \n",
    "- Trees provide **moderate insertion/deletion** \n",
    "  - (quicker than Arrays and slower than Unordered Linked Lists). \n",
    "- Like Linked Lists and unlike Arrays, Trees **don’t have an upper limit** on the number of nodes \n",
    "- as nodes are linked using pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main applications of trees\n",
    "\n",
    "- Manipulate **hierarchical** data. \n",
    "- Make information **easy to search** (see **tree traversal**). \n",
    "- **Manipulate sorted lists** of data. \n",
    "- As a workflow for compositing digital images for visual effects. \n",
    "- Router algorithms \n",
    "- Form of multi-stage decision-making (see business chess). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "- A tree whose elements have **at most 2 children** is called a binary tree. \n",
    "- Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, \n",
    "- we typically name them the left and right child. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Tree Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "- A tree is **represented by a pointer** to the **topmost node** of the tree. \n",
    "- If the tree is empty, then the value of the root is NULL. \n",
    "- **A Tree node** contains the following parts. \n",
    "  - **Data** \n",
    "  - **Pointer** to the **left** child \n",
    "  - **Pointer** to the **right** child\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Operation On Binary Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inserting** an element.\n",
    "- **Removing** an element.\n",
    "- **Searching** for an element.\n",
    "- **Traversing** an element.\n",
    "  - There are **three types of traversals** in a binary tree which will be discussed ahead.\n",
    "    - PreOrder Traversal\n",
    "    - InOrder Traversal\n",
    "    - PostOrder Traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "### Auxiliary Operation On Binary Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Finding the height** of the tree\n",
    "- **Find the level** of the tree\n",
    "- **Finding the size** of the entire tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications of Binary Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "- In compilers, Expression Trees are used which is an application of binary tree.\n",
    "- Huffman coding trees are used in data compression algorithms.\n",
    "- Priority Queue is another application of binary tree that is used for searching maximum or minimum in O(1) time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Tree Traversals\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PreOrder Traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "- root – left child – right child. \n",
    "- the root node is traversed first then its left child and finally the right child.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### InOrder Traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "- left child – root – right child.  \n",
    "- the left child is traversed first then its root node and finally the right child.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PostOrder Traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "- left child – right child – root.  \n",
    "- the left child is traversed first then the right child and finally its root node."
