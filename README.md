## Deadline

- 20220820 ~ 20220828

## Objectives

1. understand the concepts and try to draw them all on paper.
2. learn to utilize the fundamental DSA and their variants.
3. implement them in python.
4. start to solve the problems at LeetCode.

## Data Structures in Python

### Built-In

- List: mutable, ordered
  - just like dynamic sized arrays in other languages.
  - the most powerful tool in Python.
- Tuple: immutable, ordered
  - faster than List.
- Set: mutable, unordered
  - elements are not duplicated.
- Dictionary: mutable, ordered (Python 3.7 and above)
  - Keys are not duplicated.

### User-Defined

[Summary](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-data-structure-types-classifications-and-applications/#classification:~:text=Classification%20of%20Data%20Structure%3A%C2%A0)

- Linear
  - Static
    - **Array**
  - Dynamic
    - **Stack**
    - **Queue**
    - **Linked List**
- None-Linear
  - **Tree** - Heap - Trie
  - **Graph**
  - [Tree vs Graph](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-graph-and-tree/#:~:text=by%20following%20Fig.-,Graph%20vs%20Tree,-The%20basis%20of)

### Common Operations
